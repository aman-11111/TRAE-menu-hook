What is included: 
This is an expansion of ThelIndra55's TRAE-menu-hook  (https://github.com/TheIndra55/TRAE-menu-hook) to enable ROTTR loading of external mod file.
It does not offer any menu, it load mod files (*.tr2mesh *.tr2pcd) into game on game start, no need to install these files to update tiger archive.
This currently only works for steam build 1026 and the current stream build (1027 ???).

Installtion:
-copy d3d12.dll and ROTTR-Menu-Hook.asi from bin\ direcotry to ROTTR installation directory.
-create a mods\ subdirectory under ROTTR installation directory

To convert existing mods:
- Assumptions: all .tr2mesh and .tr2pcd  file conatins section number in their file name.
copy  ??????.drm and the corresponding *.tr2mesh *.tr2pcd file to the mod_prep_tools\ directory
- switch to mod_prep_tools\ dir, run  convert.cmd  <drm file name>
- if all goes well, you will get a mod_out\ folder contain the renamed assets. 
- rename mod_out\ to something like 00001_<mod_name>\ and move this directory inside <ROTTR_game_dir>/mods/
- you can have more than one  000??_<mod_name> inside mods/. The bigger 000?? number mods override the lowest number if they contain the same asset file name
 

-Uninstall a mods:
delete the 000??_<mod name> folder

-uninstall hook
delete  d3d12.dll and ROTTR-menu-hook.asi
